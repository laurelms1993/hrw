Healthy Relationships Week is a national campaign led by Alpha Chi Omega. 
The goal of Healthy Relationships Week is to foster the development of healthy relationships, and by so doing, prevent domestic violence and sexual assault.</p>

<p> Alpha Chi Omega created the campaign as a way to further involve sisters in the movement. In a release, Alpha Chi Omega Executive Director Tami Shields Silverman said  “Healthy Relationships Week reinforces what we want our members to take away from our philanthropic focus on domestic violence awareness, education and prevention. It’s about giving our members the support and resources to grow as real, strong women, while also instilling trust and confidence to know when and how to ask for help.”</p> </div>
