We are the women of the Kappa Nu chapter of Alpha Chi Omega at Carnegie Mellon University. We are computer Scientists, Mathematicians, Dramaturgs, Historians, Creative Writers, Engineers, Artists, Physicists, Architects, Biologists, Stateticians, Writers, Singers, Business Women, Philosophers, Chemists, and more. </br>

We are a relatively new chapter and we strive to make a difference on our campus by empowering women and promoting domestic violence awareness.</br>

<p>Write on a piece of paper (or a whiteboard to save paper) "I support healthy relationships becauseâ€¦" and complete the sentence with your reasons for being part of the movement. You post them on Facebook, Tumblr or Instagram and tag it with #HRW, #healthyAXOlove and #CMUHRW.
